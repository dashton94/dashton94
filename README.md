Hi, I'm Dominic Ashton, a graduating astrophysics PhD student (University of Southampton) and data scientist. I specialise in big data statistical analysis using python as my primary language, with 5 years of active research experience. 

I am currently job searching for data science roles (or similar) based in London, UK. To contact me about job opportunities, see my linkedin page: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominic-ashton/ 

I here showcase a few data science mini projects which I have put together over the past couple of years, each utilising a broad range of skills and methods. Each project started as a novel idea which I then developed in my spare time between PhD research as an fun exercise. These currently include geospatial mapping/visualisations of GPS data obtained from the strava API; a Monte-Carlo forecaster of a team road race and a statistical analysis of a large running data set, which includes web scraping and Bayesian methods. 

These are just some taster examples of concepts which have interested me (and predominantly focus on sports/running data)! I also plan to add more projects in future.
